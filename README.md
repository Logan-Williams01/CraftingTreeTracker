CraftingTreeTracker is a python app designed to create and track any game's crafting tree for use alongside your favorite games. 
  
Whether it's tracking items needed for a large project, calculating whether it's better to sell base components or craft up/break down, or help navigating a game's too-complicated crafting system, 
CraftingTreeTracker aims to replace your side monitor's spreadsheet with a dedicated application tailored for your needs.

FEATURES:
Create Items with a name, image(optional) and a "sell value"(optional, useful for games with economies)
Create Recipes using Items, specifying quantities, crafting types(craft, smelting, etc), times(for non instant crafts)
Calculate profits for Recipes (is it better to sell as base materials, or crafting them together?)
Simple GUI for navigating and visualizing your tree (no graph view)
Easy saving, loading, and sharing via JSON files
