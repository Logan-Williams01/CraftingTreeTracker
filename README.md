CraftingTreeTracker is a python app designed to create and track any game's crafting tree for use alongside your favorite games. 
  
Whether it's tracking items needed for a large project, calculating whether it's better to sell base components or craft up/break down, or help navigating a game's too-complicated crafting system, 
CraftingTreeTracker aims to replace your side monitor's spreadsheet with a dedicated application tailored for your needs.
